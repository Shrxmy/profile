The main design and inspiration was based of [craftdogz](https://www.craftz.dog/) homepage. I just added a spice of my design taste and creativity at the same time.

With his video I was able to learn more about React and THREE.js. Check [Here](https://youtu.be/bSMZgXzC9AA)

The 3D model was based on ["Yuna Figure (World of Final Fantasy)"](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/yuna-figure-world-of-final-fantasy-9be8455b25ec4e00887657e563f7823a) by [Robukan](https://sketchfab.com/robukan) licensed under [CC-BY-4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)

Pretty cute model NGL but you can get more cute and great models from [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/).

BTW the code here is all typed by me, I mainly was just following lines throughout the video but at the same time my format of code is different and also I have added more things than what you can normally see on the video.
It's a matter of learning code so I reccomend typing the code as you can understand the problem and at the same time learn something else aside from what is taught.
